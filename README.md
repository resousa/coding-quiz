### Summary

This coding quiz is a combination of what I have leared so far in the 2 months I have been attending coding classes. HTML was used to create the general page layout. From there I utilized Bootstrap to create a responsive layout and clean buttons. I also used JavaScript, but I really put a focus on using as much jQuery as possible. A key feature of this quiz is the leaderboard. It was created using local storage. This give the user the ability to compare high scores.
